      In this classic fable, the Hare is very proud of his speed and boasts about how he can easily win any race. Tired of his arrogance, the Tortoise challenges the Hare to a race. The confident Hare laughs at the idea of losing to a slow-moving Tortoise but agrees to the race. As the race begins, the Hare takes off quickly, leaving the Tortoise far behind. Confident that he will win, the Hare decides to take a nap halfway through the race.

      Meanwhile, the Tortoise keeps moving steadily and consistently, never stopping. The Hare sleeps for longer than he intended, and by the time he wakes up, he realizes that the Tortoise has almost reached the finish line. Despite his best efforts to catch up, the Hare is too late. The Tortoise crosses the finish line first, winning the race. The lesson from the story is clear: slow and steady wins the race, emphasizing the value of perseverance and not underestimating others based on appearances.
